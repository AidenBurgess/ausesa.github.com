Hey everyone,

We're ready to kick off semester one with a bang, and to be part of that you need to sign up.
Admittedly, you can do it all online, so despite the title, there won't be a rush to get in the door.
Sign up [here](/join) and then pay online or at one of our events in the first weeks of uni.

Speaking of events, there's plenty to go around, first there's the SESA Mixer at 5 P.M. Thursday the 5th of March in Engineering Cafetira (note: it is no longer in leech), and then we have our first bAGM at 6 P.M. Tuesday the 10th of March in Engineering room 404.503, both with pizza for all atendees and the ability to sign up if you don't want to pay online.
We've also got priority attendance at the Microsoft Student Accelerator Showcase which starts 6 P.M. sharp on Monday the 9th of March at the Auckland Town Hall (you need to register online for this one, so see our Facebook group for more details).

If this is all to much to keep track of we've got good news, you can now follow our new [Google calendar](/events) to keep up to date.

See you soon, your exec team.
