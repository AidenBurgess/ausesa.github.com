Welcome back from your SESA blogger! It's been another great SESA half-semester (who would've guessed?), and here's an ordered list of everything what happened.

1. SESA Learns: Data Structures for Interviews - We revised the important data structures to know for interviews, because you never know when you'll need a data structure.
2. Grad Series - Grads <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoecai/">Zoe Cai</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-mehta-ba1938b4/?ppe=1">Aman Mehta</a> shared with us the greatness of grad life- its highs, lows, and ability to defy expectations.
3. <a href="http://script-wars.com/">ScriptWars</a> Coding Competition - SESA Members <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-brown-374356130/">James Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamtbrand/">Liam Brand</a> created which puts AI scripts up against each to play a game (in our case, "Tank Game").
4. Cardboard Night - Another fun, causal night of board games, card games, pizza, and Subway documented with a video embedded in this post.

We have also recently created a <a href="https://discord.gg/AKNu6td">SESA Discord</a>. Feel free to join us!

We look forward to closing out 2017 with a non-fizzle. Stay tuned for all of it- including out end of year formal dinner, and the Biannual General Meeting. Expect more content coming to this website and our other social media in the near future as well!

Cheers,

the SESA Exec Team
