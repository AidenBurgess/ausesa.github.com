Hi Everyone,

Welcome (back) to SESA, we hope you're having an awesome year!

We had a ton of interest at our mixer earlier this month, and we're pleased to say that we've got a heap more excitement lined up for the rest of the year. First of we've got our Biannual General Meeting at this *Wednesday* at 6pm in Engineering room 403.407, this is where we'll run you down further on the great year we have planned and will also see the election of our Part II Rep for 2016. On top of that, we have LANs, movie nights, board game nights and much more to sink you teeth into this year.

As always, our fantastic sponsors allow us to run all this for you and I'm pleased to say that this year we have, joining returning sponsors Orion Health, Vista Entertainment and Atlassian we have new sponsors Palantir, Eroad, Olympic Software and Winternz by ICE Professionals. You can get to know these sponsors and more a little better at our Careers Evening on March 22nd as well as at many events that each company is running on campus, so keep an eye out for those.

All in all, it's looking to be a great year for SESA and we hope that you have as much of a blast as we do.

Cheers, the SESA Exec Team
