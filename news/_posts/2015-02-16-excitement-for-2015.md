As the start of uni approaches, SESA has heaps of exciting news for the upcoming year.

As usual we have a ton of great events for you, but this year we're getting started even earlier with The Sesa Mixer on Thursday 5th of March in Leech Study Area at 5pm,
followed swiftly by our first Bi-Annual General Meeting also in the coming weeks.

We've also got a plethora of LANs, movie nights, shadow classes and all that good stuff for you throughout the year.

Cheers, your exec team.
