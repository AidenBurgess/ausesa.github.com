Greetings Brothers and Sisters,

We're Excited to announce that SESA is changing into Σεσα (Sigma-Epsilon-sigma-alpha), the software fraternasororitity.
We're making this change, in the tradition of American Students associations in order to revitalise the club.

What does this mean to you you might ask?

* More racism.
* More drinking.
* Strange rituals.
* Alcohol poisoning.
* Even more racism.

We hope that these changes are welcomed by all.

Yours, the SESA Exec.
