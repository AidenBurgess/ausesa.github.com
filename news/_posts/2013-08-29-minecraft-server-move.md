Hey everyone, just a heads up that the server address has changed port. Now when you enter the server address you will need to append 25566, suchlike:

mc.sesa.org.nz:25566

The reason for this is that Scott has graciously agreed to host the server on his much more powerful machine, hopefully resulting in massively improved performance (it was kinda chugging on the old machine!).

So thanks Sgoo, and happy playing!
